# Tractor Store — Documentation

The Tractor Store is a four-app micro-frontend (MFE) system: a thin
**host** shell plus three independently-deployed **remotes**, each
owned by a separate team. The host owns the URL and the page chrome;
the remotes ship UI as web components and link to each other through
_intent IDs_ instead of hard-coded URLs. All composition happens at
runtime — there is no build-time wiring between apps.

The runtime is [Native Federation v4][nf]. It is built on ECMAScript
Modules and Import Maps, so what we ship is plain browser-native code
with a small orchestration layer on top.

## New to micro-frontends?

A micro-frontend architecture splits a single web application into
smaller apps that can be built, tested, and deployed independently.
Each team owns its slice end-to-end and the browser composes them at
runtime.

This project follows the [Tractor Store Blueprint][blueprint] — a
reference scenario for comparing MFE techniques across frameworks.
The teams are named for what they do in the customer journey
(**Explore**, **Decide**, **Checkout**), not for technical layers.
That vertical split is the canonical micro-frontends decomposition
described on [micro-frontends.org][mfo].

Three ideas carry the weight in this repo:

1. **Custom elements** (web components). Every UI fragment a remote
   exposes is registered as a `<mfe-*>` HTML tag. The host (or any
   other remote) places that tag in the DOM and the browser does the
   rest. The contract is plain HTML — no Angular import crosses team
   boundaries.
2. **A central event bus** (`window.__NF_REGISTRY__`). Remotes
   publish and subscribe to small, _typed_ channels instead of
   calling each other directly. Each channel is defined once with
   `defineChannel<Payload>(name)` in `@ng-internal/event-bus`;
   emitter and listener then share the same compile-time contract.
   Navigation, store selection, cart sync, and auth state all ride on
   this bus.
3. **Intent-based navigation.** A button in the _decide_ micro frontend that should
   open the cart never types `'/checkout/cart'`. It uses the
   `[appNavigateTo]` directive with the intent `'checkout.cart'`,
   and the host translates that to a URL. A team can rename its
   routes without touching anyone else's code.
4. **Host-owned authentication.** The shell owns the session,
   protects non-explore routes, redirects anonymous users to `/login`,
   and sends them back to the original URL after successful login.

Together these four keep the apps decoupled. The rest of this doc
set explains how each piece is implemented.

The manifest is the only static "wiring": every app fetches it at
startup and uses it to locate the others. The dotted lines are
_cross-remote fragment loads_ — a remote can mount another remote's
custom element inside its own page without going through the host.

- **[Architecture](./architecture.md)** — what the host owns, what
  each remote owns, and the three decoupling mechanisms (custom
  elements, the event bus, intent-based navigation) plus how shared
  libraries are scoped.
- **[Authentication](./authentication.md)** — the host-owned auth
  contract, public vs protected routes, `/login`, and `returnUrl`.
- **[Navigation](./navigation.md)** — the intent-based navigation
  system and why it is the load-bearing piece of the host/remote
  decoupling.
- **[Features](./features.md)** — what each team ships, the
  fragments they expose, the events they emit, and the cross-remote
  dependencies between them.
- **[Docker & CI](./architecture.md#docker--containerisation)** —
  multi-stage Docker builds, local compose, and the branch-aware Azure
  Pipeline.
